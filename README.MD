## What I intend to build

## Requirements
To run this project you might need to have `node` alongside `babel`, `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server` installed globally, this is included inside the `package.json` file, the `node` version is included in the `.rvmrc` file to avoid confusions about what node js version you should use.

## How to run
First of all, since this is node_ish_, as usual, run in your terminal:
```
npm install && npm start
```
This will install all the required dependencies and will run `webpack-dev-server` through the `npm start` command.

Open http://localhost:3333/ in the browser you most like, and I wish you like Google Chrome as I do, and... voila!
